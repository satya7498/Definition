What is a Flowchart? 
Flowchart is a graphical representation of an algorithm. Programmers often use it as a program-planning tool to solve a problem. It makes use of symbols which are connected among them to indicate the flow of information and processing. 


Basic Symbols used in Flowchart Designs
1. Terminal: The oval symbol indicates Start, Stop and Halt in a program’s logic flow. A pause/halt is generally used in a program logic under some error conditions. Terminal is the first and last symbols in the flowchart.
2. Input/Output: A parallelogram denotes any function of input/output type. Program instructions that take input from input devices and display output on output devices are indicated with parallelogram in a flowchart. 

3.  Processing: A box represents arithmetic instructions. All arithmetic processes such as adding, subtracting, multiplication and division are indicated by action or process symbol.
4. Decision Diamond symbol represents a decision point. Decision based operations such as yes/no question or true/false are indicated by diamond in flowchart. 
5. Connectors: Whenever flowchart becomes complex or it spreads over more than one page, it is useful to use connectors to avoid any confusions. It is represented by a circle. 

6. Flow lines: Flow lines indicate the exact sequence in which instructions are executed. Arrows represent the direction of flow of control and relationship among different symbols of flowchart. 
Advantages of Flowchart:
   * Flowcharts are better way of communicating the logic of system.
   * Flowcharts act as a guide for blueprint during program designed.
   * Flowcharts helps in debugging process.
   * With the help of flowcharts programs can be easily analyzed.
   * It provides better documentation.
   * Flowcharts serve as a good proper documentation.
Disadvantages of Flowchart:
   * It is difficult to draw flowchart for large and complex programs.
   * In this their is no standard to determine the amount of detail.
   * Difficult to reproduce the flowcharts.
   * It is very difficult to modify the Flowchart.
